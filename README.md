# 🤖 AI Project Type Classifier

This is an interactive **AI Project Classifier** built with Streamlit. It helps product and AI strategy teams **identify the correct AI project type** based on user needs, industry context, and data usage.

## 🔍 What it does

It asks guided questions about:
- Your target industry (e.g. Healthcare, Finance, Retail)
- The project’s main objective (e.g. Generate content, Recommend products)
- The type of data used (text, image, video, etc.)
- Whether the project needs user interaction, long context, or original generation

Then it:
- Classifies the AI project type (e.g. Chatbot, AI Copilot, Content Generation)
- Provides a detailed justification
- Generates a report summary
